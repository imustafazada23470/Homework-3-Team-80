        <h1>Website Project</h1>
  <h3><i>1. Preparation</i></h3>
  <p>We, as a team, got together to refresh our knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JS.
  Beyond the tutorial of Code.org course, we decided to watch other tutorials from YouTube 
  or free courses of Udemy. Afterwards, we distributed our responsibility into each-other
  and started to work on it day by day. The most challenging part for us was syncing each of
  our VS Code and GitHub together. Through sufficient help of TAs, 
  we have dealt with that. </p>
  
  <h3><i>2. Practice</i></h3>
  <p>We were having both online and in-person meetings to evaluate what we have and 
  ensure that we follow the steps correctly. Trying to contribute equally was our first prioritize.
  We used GitHub for version control and task management tools to stay organized. 
  Additionally, we focused on solving problems together, 
  such as debugging and ensuring responsiveness, 
  which helped improve both our technical and teamwork skills.
  </p>
  <h3><i>3. Implementation</i></h3>
  <p>Once we finalized our plans, we moved into the implementation phase. This involved integrating our individual works into our website. 
  Each team member focused on their planned section, and we collectively ensured that the overall design and functionality matched with how we have imagined it. 
  The process included writing correct and clean code and testing that it works on different devices. 
  We utilized GitHub for version control, allowing us to track changes, review code collaboratively, and figure any conflicts out effectively. 
  Through this, we not only completed our duty but also improved our collaborative skills. 
  We regularly hold debugging sessions to identify and fix any issues, making our website as user-friendly as possible.
