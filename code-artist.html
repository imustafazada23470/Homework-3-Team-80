            <p>Code art, also known as generative art, is created using algorithms and computer code. It allows artists to produce unique, dynamic pieces that evolve and change with every execution. This art form is a beautiful blend of creativity and technology.</p>

            <h2 class="algorithm">Algorithmic Design</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">At the heart of code art lies the algorithmâ€”a step-by-step procedure for calculations. These algorithms can generate intricate visual patterns, shapes, and designs based on predefined rules and randomness.</p>
            <p>Example: A simple algorithm might randomly place circles on a canvas, each time creating a unique pattern.</p>
